# ü§ñ GenAI-IRS: Intelligent Document Question Answering System

A powerful, LLM-backed information retrieval system built using **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **Streamlit**. GenAI-IRS enables users to upload and interact with PDF documents using natural language queries. With semantic search and metadata-aware responses, it delivers contextually accurate answers that are traceable to their sources.


## üöÄ Key Features

- üìÑ **Multi-PDF Upload**: Upload and process multiple PDF documents via an intuitive sidebar.
- üîç **Semantic Search Engine**: Uses FAISS to chunk and embed text for rapid, vector-based retrieval.
- üß† **LLM-Driven Answers**: Backed by **GROQ‚Äôs `llama3-70b-8192`**, delivering high-quality, structured responses.
- üí¨ **Context-Persistent Conversations**: Maintains memory using `ConversationBufferMemory` for coherent dialogue.
- üßæ **Source Attribution**: Answers include document source references for transparency and verification.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Minimalist UI**: Clean, responsive Streamlit interface for seamless interaction.
